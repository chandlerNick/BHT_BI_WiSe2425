The truck in which they were riding was likely picked up, flipped over, and slammed into the ground several times. The coroner stated that the victims died instantly. One of the victims was ejected from the truck, which then struck the top of a large propane tank. Because of the ensuing propane leak, the victim still in the truck could not be removed until the following day, when the propane was off-loaded from the tank. Both of the victims in the vehicle were residents of a mobile home who were trying to flee the tornado. The home from which they fled sustained only minor damage. At least four other people were significantly injured as they were picked up by tornadic winds and hurled 100 yards. Their injuries were compounded by wind-blown debris. Eight victims were admitted to a local hospital to remove debris which penetrated their bodies, and two others were sent to regional hospitals for serious injuries. Three mobile homes were flattened, a brick house had its roof and several walls blown off, and numerous vehicles were tossed around. A total of about a dozen residences were destroyed or severely damaged in Perry County. Perry County was designated a federal disaster area, enabling individual residents to apply for relief.

This was due to a combination of both severe thunderstorm winds and a strong tornado.  The wind damage, which had ended just south of Uvalde, once again was observed beginning just west of the Agape area by the team.  The damage continued toward the east nearly one quarter mile to the Agape compound.  Roof damage was noted at the first buildings, along with widespread damage to trees.  Continuing to the east, the team found a mobile home that had been completely destroyed with the debris deposited about 30 yards to the south.  This was the first time damage had been thrown in any direction except to the east and is believed to be just east of the starting point of the tornado.  About 50 yards further to the east, an asphalt road was observed to have chunks of the topping removed and tossed toward the southeast. Very nearby, a large three-story concrete and steel-beam gymnasium valued at one million dollars had been gutted by the storm.  The windward, west side was not blown inward as would have occurred with severe thunderstorm winds.  Instead, it was pulled outward.  A 40-foot steel beam had been bolted in a dozen different places to the building.  The beam was pulled from the building and thrown back 15 feet to the northwest.  Although many of the supporting steel beams held, several were pulled away and tossed.  Concrete blocks, filled solid with concrete in their construction, had been ripped out of the building and lay tossed and strewn over the area.  Much of the wall structure was destroyed.  Pieces of sheet metal were strewn to the east and southeast for nearly one half mile.  Additional damage to vegetation stretched for another 2 miles east of the gymnasium.  Some of this damage was clearly due to severe thunderstorm winds and some of the damage was due to the tornado.  Based on the level of damage of the mobile home and the gymnasium, the tornado was rated F2.  The path width was estimated at 50 yards and the path length was estimated at 2 miles.  From the reports available, it is thought the tornado developed about 1020 pm CST and dissipated around 1025 pm CST.  It is the strongest tornado in South Central Texas since the evening of October 12, 2001, when an F3 tornado struck Stonewall, and an F2 tornado struck Hondo."

A dryline pushed northeast with the low into the state.  Strong moisture transport took place ahead of the storm with dew points reaching the mid 50s to low 60s over Iowa as afternoon temperatures were in the 60 to 70 degree range.  Strong south winds in the low levels were in place with speeds in the 35 to 45 kt range.  The atmosphere destabilized during the afternoon with lifted indices reaching -7 by the 
early afternoon.  CAPE values were not all that great, at about 1000 J/kg.  The freezing level during the storms was relatively low, at about 10,700 feet.  Thunderstorms developed in western Iowa and lifted northeast at 50 to 55 MPH during the afternoon.  These formed in the warm sector.  At the same time, the dryline pushed into western Iowa during the late afternoon.  The storms from the dryline produced hail and strong winds, along with 2 small tornadoes.

It entered Hendersonville from Goodlettsville at 1312 CST, and struck Gallatin at 1325 CST. An aerial survey determined this tornado had a path length of 22.75 miles from Davidson County and into Sumner County. 7 people died directly as a result of the tornado. One woman, who was 83 years old, died of a heart attack the day the tornado swept through Gallatin, and is considered an indirect death due to the tornado causing her heart attack. All 7 fatalities happened in Gallatin. There was extensive damage to homes and businesses. 700 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in Sumner County. The City of Hendersonville had 80 homes destroyed, As a result, Hendersonville city officials are considering installing tornado sirens in the city.

Volunteer State Community College in southwest Gallatin was heavily damaged as were several car dealerships across the road. Vol State reopend 10 days after the tornado struck on Monday, April 17. 

There were about 400 faculty, staff and students on campus at the time the tornado struck. that day. Ms. Angie Jowers, public relations director for the college, stated that having routine tornado safety drills paid off on April 7th. 

Mr. Steve Doremus, spokesman for the Sumner County Schools, said that all 25,500 students were safe from the tornado because of routine tornado drills done in the county's 42 schools. 

Vol State school officials placed damage at the campus around $56 million. There was $69 million in damage in Sumner County alone. One estimate for damage done by tornadoes across Middle Tennssee on April 7 was placed at $391 million. 

Unfortunately, at night, looters came out to Gallatin. A nightly curfew was imposed for a while to curb the looting. The National Guard was called in to help with security matters and debris removal. By May 4, 2006, 23 people were arrested for looting in Gallatin. 

Several people died inside their homes. A NWS Storm Survey Team discovered that 1/2 million dollar brick homes were not built as well as one might have expected. Cinder blocks were filled with concrete, and boards were nailed to the cinder block as the base for the foundation. The strong winds caused some brick homes to move off the cinder blocks and collapse. This was observed in the Woodhaven Subdivision in Gallatin."

This was the first tornado to hit near the campus in 35 years and the University was closed on Friday April 14th for safety reasons.

The KIOW ASOS at the airport on the southwest side of the city recorded a peak wind gust of 49 knots (57 mph) at 1931 CST.  This gust was likely the result of the rear flank downdraft as the tornado neared the intersection of U.S. 6 and highway 1 northeast of the airport.

At 1932-1933 CST power was lost at the Johnson County Sheriff Office with telephone lines, LAN, and automated systems going down as the tornado passed over the building.

Several historic buildings were damaged downtown and it is unknown whether or not they can or will be saved.  The tornado damaged the Alpha Chi Omega sorority house and damaged many student apartments located just off the campus on Iowa, Dodge, and Governor streets.

Tornado began just north of I-80 4 miles west of Le Claire at 2042 CST.  The tornado traveled east northeast crossing 257th Avenue just south of 205th Street and dissipated on 205th Street about 0.5 miles east of the intersection of 257th Avenue and 205th Street at 2045 CST.

The corner of a wooden roof was torn off a cattle building and boards scattered (some nailed themselves into the wall of the corn crib next to it).  The entire roof was lifted and then set back down.  The south cinder block wall collapsed inward on the cattle building and the north walls bowed out to the northeast from the roof lifting off.  A large shed door on the east side of the corn crib next to the cattle building was torn off and flung 50 yards to the northeast.  The door hit a 100 year old tree trunk and knocked it out of the ground.  A window was blown out on the east end of the corn crib next to the original cattle building.  The window landed on the northwest corner of the property up and over on the opposite side of farmhouse some 975-980 yards distance.

Part of the steel sheeting was peeled back on the southwest corner roof of a new machine shed located to the north of the cattle building.  A skylight window was sucked out of another freestanding cattle barn located to the east of the original cattle building.

A wooden dog house on the porch of the farmhouse was flipped onto its roof and a power pole was knocked out a couple of miles northeast of the farm.",Rated F1

Moisture was somewhat limited with a narrow band of one to one and one quarter inch precipitable water values lifting northeast into the state.  Temperatures warmed into the low 80s during the afternoon, but convection was hindered in most areas with dew points in the 30s to low 40s.  A narrow band of dew points in the upper 50s to low 60s pushed into southwest Iowa by late afternoon.  At the same time, a pronounced dryline pushed across Kansas.  An arc of thunderstorms formed in response to the dryline and moved into western Iowa during the evening.  Initially the airmass was quite unstable when the storms formed  Lifted indices were around -8 C. with CAPE values in the 1500 to 2000 J/kg range.  There were some reports of hail, but that was limited in spite of the 11,500 foot freezing level.  The hail reports that were received were in the three quarter to one inch diameter range.  During the early evening the LCL fell to around 600 meters.  There were two waves of thunderstorms.  The initial set moved through during the period of high winds  over the southwest and central counties.  These storms were very elevated and clearly in an inverted ""V"" sounding environment.  The downdrafts from the storms enhanced the winds as they passed.  One produced downburst winds around 60 MPH in Grimes and tore a trailer door off.  One tornado touched down in Audubon County southwest of Audubon.  The tornado touched down in open fields and did not cause any damage.   There were a few reports of high winds due to the storms.  A combination of two things caused the high winds.  One was the storms themselves initially as the flow in the low levels, the lowest 500 meters, was in the 50 to 60 kt range.  The other occurred as the storms started to weaken.  Soundings indicated that during the dissipation stage, the storms moved into a near storm environment that exhibited an inverted ""V"" sounding.  This was the case in Taylor County at Lenox, where high winds tor the roof off of a hardware store and ripped the roof off of a hog confinement building.  Several hogs were killed at the confinement farm.  In Adams County, high winds resulted in the collapse of strong thunderstorms over the northern part of the county.  The outflow rush produced winds estimated around 75 MPH south of Prescott.  Numerous machine sheds and barns were damaged in the area.  Eight inch diameter trees were downed as well as a few TV and Radio towers.   Other reports of winds in the 60 to 65 MPH range were received, but little damage was reported.",Tornado touched down in open fields southwest of Audubon.  Little to no damage occurred.

Ten aircraft, some of which were vintage planes, were also damaged inside the hangars, with 5 planes declared a complete loss. In addition to the numerous videos, there was also some evidence of anti-cyclonic swirls in sprayed aircraft oil. The two structures were estimated at about $1 million. The damage to the airplanes were estimated from $35,000-$225,000 each for an estimated total loss of $500,000 to aircraft at the airport. The total damage to the El Reno Regional Airport was approximately $1.5 million."

May 5 Severe Thunderstorm Event Summary...Another outbreak of severe thunderstorms affected parts of the west Texas South Plains region during the afternoon and evening hours of the 5th.  This activity was part of a widespread severe weather event across much of west Texas, including the Permian Basin where at least one significant tornado occurred. 

Severe convection erupted during the late afternoon hours along a warm front that was oriented west-to-east over the southern portions of the South Plains. These storms quickly evolved into supercells, and produced large hail, damaging winds, and at least four tornadoes. Although the tornadoes remained over open farmland, tornadic winds destroyed to center-pivot irrigation systems northwest of Brownfield (Terry County). This resulted in property losses of half a million dollars.

The supercellular convection evolved into a cluster of severe multicell storms by early evening as it continued to propagate eastward along the boundary. A small linear complex characterized by a mini bow-shaped radar echo produced a locally intense downburst near Lake Alan Henry in southeastern Garza County. Winds estimated to exceed 90 MPH destroyed a number of mobile homes and vehicles near the lake, and injured one resident.

Total economical losses sustained over the South Plains region during the outbreak were estimated to just under $1 million.","The public observed a tornado near the intersection of Farm to Market Roads 179 and 211 around 16:30 CST. The tornado, which developed beneath a rapidly intensifying supercell thunderstorm, remained over open farmland and no damage was reported."

These storms quickly evolved into supercells, and produced large hail, damaging winds, and at least four tornadoes. Although the tornadoes remained over open farmland, tornadic winds destroyed to center-pivot irrigation systems northwest of Brownfield (Terry County). This resulted in property losses of half a million dollars.

The supercellular convection evolved into a cluster of severe multicell storms by early evening as it continued to propagate eastward along the boundary. A small linear complex characterized by a mini bow-shaped radar echo produced a locally intense downburst near Lake Alan Henry in southeastern Garza County. Winds estimated to exceed 90 MPH destroyed a number of mobile homes and vehicles near the lake, and injured one resident.

Total economical losses sustained over the South Plains region during the outbreak were estimated to just under $1 million.",A second brief tornado was observed by storm spotters in rural areas northwest of Brownfield. No damage was reported.

A tornado developed in Martin County in open fields north of County Road D4800 and east of County Road D2651.  Based on spotter reports, the tornado was visible at 8:02 pm CDT just south of CR D4800 and west of Farm to Market Road 829 (FM 829), south-southeast of Patricia.  According to spotter reports, it took on a stove-pipe like shape and continued to move to the east-southeast along FM 829.  A few minutes later, the tornado pulled an oil pump jack and well head from the ground.  The pump jack was estimated to weigh about 35,000 pounds by an oil company representative.  The well head was anchored in the ground by an additional 35,000 pounds of weight from pipe below the ground.  Southward along FM 829, four power poles were snapped four to five feet above ground and an additional six poles farther south were blown over to the east due to rear flank downdraft winds.  Another couple of minutes later, an oil heater treater weighing approximately 12,000 pounds was blown over.  The damage survey team classified the damage that occurred between 8:02pm CDT and 8:07pm CDT, when the oil heater treater was blown over, as F2 intensity damage.  After blowing over the oil heater, the tornado became rain-wrapped and crossed County Road 4600, just west of County Road D3401.  Five power poles were knocked down on County Road D3401.  Based on information received from both spotters and chasers, the tornado dissipated at 8:14pm CDT, just west of Texas Highway 137.  During the remainder of the tornado's path, it remained mainly over open country.  The damage survey team calculated the width of the tornado to be 130 yards near the end of its life.  However, the track was estimated to be between 200 and 300 yards during earlier stages of its life.  The path length was calculated to be just over six miles long."

May 9 Severe Thunderstorm and Significant Tornado Event Summary...Two isolated supercell thunderstorms developed east of a dryline that was roughly oriented along the Caprock Escarpment during the late afternoon and early evening hours of the 9th. These storms evolved into splitting supercells, and resulted in large hail up to two inches in diameter in Dickens and Motley Counties. 

The anticyclonic member from one of the mentioned storms propagated northward over Childress County during the early evening hours. The storm effectively lowered temperature-to-dewpoint depressions and locally backed the near-surface winds. A classic supercell subsequently propagated southeastward out of the Texas Panhandle and over Hall County. This storm interacted with the ""outflow boundary"" left by the departing anticyclonic storm. The southeastward propagating storm rapidly became tornadic near the northwestern corner of Childress. Large hail, damaging RFD winds, and the significant (F2) tornado resulted in nearly $6 million in damages and injured one. A school net weather instrument located at the heavily damaged Childress High School measured a peak wind gust of 109 MPH as the tornado destroyed the school's gymnasium.

A second round of isolated severe storms produced large hail over the extreme southeastern Texas Panhandle as clean-up crews worked in the damaged areas.","
A tornado resulted in significant (F2) damage along a one and half mile path through the north side of Childress during the evening hours of the 9th. The tornado developed in a residential are of northwest Childress at 20:30 CST. Damage in the neighborhood was characterized as weak, with numerous downed trees, street signs, and damaged roofs. A resident was injured when a tree fell and struck him, breaking his arm and causing minor lacerations.

The tornado then moved east toward the high school. Damage to the high school was extensive. A local television network, KVII-TV in Amarillo, operates an automated weather station on the campus as part of a regional school net. The instrument measured a 109 MPH wind gust as the tornado ripped through the facility at 20:32 CST. Damage at Childress High School was rated F1, with large brick walls blown inn and portions of the building's roof removed. The gymnasium was declared a total loss.

The tornado intensified as it continued to move east across Fair Park. A large industrial building used to house city owned emergency vehicles was completely destroyed, with extensive damage to the fleet of vehicles that were parked inside. A tennis court was destroyed by wind-blown debris, and numerous large trees were uprooted. A large stone picnic table was blown northward along the wind fields convergent axis associated with center of the tornado's path. A well-built metal bridge that spanned Park Lake was blown a considerable distance downwind. Damage along the tornado's path through the park justified a significant rating (F2) on the Fujita Tornado Damage Intensity Scale. This given the magnitude of damage observed at the industrial building site, where large steel beams were completely torn from their bolted fixtures.

The damage survey indicated that the tornado quickly weakened as it continued to move east of the park, and into more rural areas in the northeastern outskirts of the city."

Although the storms were initially non-severe, several outflow boundaries surged west from the convection and intersected the frontal boundary over Lubbock and Lynn Counties. As instability increased during the late afternoon hours, strongly towering cumulus clouds stretched pre-existing spin in the low levels of the atmosphere near the boundary interactions and resulted in at least three non-supercellular tornadoes. One tornado was highly-visible in southeastern Lubbock. The tornadoes were weak (F0), and no damage was reported by local authorities.
