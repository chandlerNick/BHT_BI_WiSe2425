A grass fire driven by wind burned 50,000 acres west of Hobbs on New Year's Day.  The western side of Hobbs had to be evacuated, including the community college, a casino, and several neighborhoods.  Three firefighters sustained minor injuries, but no one was seriously injured.  Four families were provided shelter by the Red Cross, though eleven homes were destroyed.  Two businesses and 10 vehicles also were destroyed by the fire.  

In addition to the wildfire west of Hobbs, two fires burned near Tatum in northern Lea county.  No structures were damaged in these fires, however, U.S. Highway 380 was closed from Roswell to the Texas state line during the day because of the fires.  According to local authorities, one fire near Tatum was caused by fireworks and the other was sparked by a car crash."

A grassfire spread to over 40,000 acres in Reagan and Irion counties on New Year's Day.  Newspapers originally reported the cause as sparks from a transformer.  Later, a fire department official in Big Lake reported that a hawk landed on power lines and burst into flames, starting the fire.  Because of high winds, record high temperatures, and very low relative humidities, it took firefighters 3 days to contain the wildfire.  It was extinguished a couple of days later.  One firefighter sustained 2nd degree burns to his face while fighting the fire but was treated and released from a regional burn center.  The fire was in mostly open country and thus only a hunting cabin was destroyed.    

In addition to the major fire in Reagan and Irion counties, several other small fires scorched west Texas.  Both Ector and Midland counties had fire and fireworks bans in effect for the period between New Year's Eve and January 6, 2006.  Several other counties also had fireworks bans in effect for the New Year's holiday.  

January was a dry month overall.  Several other minor fires occurred throughout west Texas, including two along Interstate 20 in Stanton.  Smoke from one of these fires reduced visibility on Interstate 20, causing a five car pile-up that resulted in two injuries.  Another fire in Scurry county, near the Inadale Cotton Gin, burned 415 modules of cotton, each worth around $3,000.  Each of the modules contains about 10 bales of cotton.

Damage estimates in the above entry include all fires that burned in Texas during the month of January."

A large wildfire ignited near U.S. Highway 385 just north of Dimmitt on the afternoon of the 12th. A frontal passage caused a westerly to northerly wind shift that rapidly changed the fire's direction of growth and spread. The fire destroyed three abandoned structures on the northwest side of the city. Resources from surrounding counties as well as the Texas Forest Service were utilized to battle the blaze. Two forest service air tankers provided airdrops and managed to contain the fire before it spread into the city. This undoubtedly averted extensive damage to homes and businesses.

The strong winds blew the sparks into the parched grassland, triggering the fire. The fire caused thick smoke to blow across the Kansas Turnpike, resulting in a two-car accident and eventually shutting the roadway down for 45 minutes. In all, the fire charred 10,700 acres of grassland, damaged or destroyed 10 outbuildings, caused minor damage to two homes, set three oil wells ablaze, and caused the evacuation of Oil Hill Elementary School.

The NWS first learned of the fire through a cooperative observer in Tatum, New Mexico, who submitted a storm report online at 11:42am MST.  New Mexico State Road 206 was closed by the New Mexico State Police between Tatum and McDonald due to the fire.  News reports in later days indicated that the final acreage of the burn area was 92,390 acres.  The fire was contained Monday, March 13th after burning down the U.S. Post Office, two primary residences, four abandoned homes, three barns, and several pieces of fire equipment.

The fire began when sparks from a torch being used to dismantle vacant house trailers ignited nearby combustibles. The strong west winds and the unseasonably dry weather conditions helped spread the fire quickly. The fire occurred on Benson Road (Sussex County Route 224). Twenty fire companies battled the blaze and came from as far north as Smyrna and as far south as Millville. In all about 200 firefighters battled the blaze. Three fire fighters suffered smoke inhalation and another suffered dehydration and exhaustion. Smoke from the fire was visibile from as far north as Milford. All six vacant house trailers and a vacant two story home were destroyed. The flames also melted the siding of one occupied home. It took over three hours to contain the fire.  Two smaller wildfires occurred on the 14th in Sussex County. One occurred between Seaford and Bridgeville and the second was also near the Benson Road fire.

Local fire departments helped prevent the fire from reaching homes on the north side of the fire. About 150 acres were consumed before the fire was contained. Through the end of March there have been 531 wildfires that have consumed 1,400 acres of woodland in New Jersey in 2006. By comparison, there were only 94 wildfires that consumed 146 acres through March 31st in 2005.  

Because of the unseasonably dry weather, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service has issued a Stage number 2 campfire restriction. No open fires were allowed either on the ground or within fire rings. Any ground fires had to be in a prepared, contained pit made of steel, stone, brick or concrete with a gravel or masonry base. All prescribed burning permits remained suspended. Agricultural open burning permits remained conditionally permitted subject to adequate precautions and the approval of the local fire warden.  

March 2006 was the driest March on record (112 years) in the state of New Jersey. The preliminary statewide precipitation average was 0.86 inches, 3.31 inches drier than normal. It was also the driest March on record at the Atlantic City International Airport. The monthly precipitation total of 0.37 inches surpassed the previous record of 0.70 inches set in 1966 and was 3.69 inches drier than normal.

April 6 High Wind and Wilfire Event Summary:  A vigorous storm system ejected eastward from the Rocky Mountains and resulted in widespread strong to severe winds and blowing dust over much of west Texas. The winds additionally contributed to yet another regional outbreak of destructive wildfires over portions of the drought-stricken states of New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma. Severe winds were common over the South Plains region with minor damage reported. At least six wildfires ignited in the winds across the South Plains and the extreme southern Texas Panhandle. One fire became a significant wind-driven wildfire that destroyed a single family home in Lamb County. Total damages from wind and fire were estimated near $200,000. No injuries were reported.","Damaging winds downed lines at a utility company sub-station west of Earth in northwestern Lamb County during the early afternoon hours. By 13:30 CST, the downed lines had sparked a dangerous wind driven wildfire that raged through several hundred acres of grasslands. Local authorities were forced to close a portion of Farm to Market Road 303 near Earth due to the fire and reduced visibilities from smoke. One home was destroyed in the blaze. No injuries were reported."

This combined with ongoing drought conditions to create an extremely critical fire weather situation over a large part of the Southern High Plains. A large wildfire was ignited by downed power lines in Hockley County. The fire destroyed one residence and injured three people. Two of the injured were fire fighters engaged in battling the blaze. The winds were indirectly responsible for another fire that destroyed a residence in Lubbock County where a large outdoor cooker was blown over. Damage estimates for the event total $250,000.","
