# TASK 2 - DUE 01.14.2025


Day 1 Meeting:
- Note that we have a break from Dec 23 to Jan 2. The bulk of the work should probably be done outside of this which means we have only ~3.5 weeks for the whole project!
- Figure out scope of project, leave today with roles and an understanding of what you need to do next.
- Make a Gantt chart to set a timeline.
